                <strong>Circuit Training</strong>
                <p>Circuit training is a high-intensity workout that combines elements of cardio and strength training for a whole body workout. Circuit training workouts offer the flexibility of mixing things up – you’ll never be tied down to a single exercise routine again. The exercises are targeted to work a specific area like your arms, glutes, legs, core and back. From your upper body to your legs and your core, you’ll definitely feel the burn that comes with fast-paced circuit training.</p>

                <strong>TRX  </strong>
                <p>Created by a Navy Seal, TRX stands for Total Body Resistance Exercise. TRX workouts use your body weight, gravity and TRX Suspension Trainers to provide a full-body workout that pushes you to your limits. As a form of resistance training, it trains your body’s strength, balance, core, and agility. </p>

                <strong>Pilates </strong>
                <p>Pilates is a low-impact exercise that aims to strengthen the muscles while improving posture and flexibility. For a long time, it’s had a reputation as the preferred exercise of models and celebrities because it predominantly targets the core. Expect slow and precise movements coupled with breath control. A strong core brought about by either contemporary or Classical Pilates will simultaneously improve your range of motion.</p>
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>HIIT</strong>
                <p>HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training, which refers to the short bursts of intense exercise alternated with low-intensity recovery periods that make up the protocol. HIIT is quick and anything but boring, as its exacting work-to-rest ratios make it arguably the most time-efficient way to exercise and burn calories. You can use the HIIT protocol to build your entire workout, or apply it to just a few sets to create super-charged finishers.</p>

                <strong>Weight training</strong>
                <p>Weight training is a type of strength training that uses weights for resistance. By creating a stress to the muscles performed with free weights (e.g. barbells and dumbbells) or by using weight machines, these exercises will enable muscles to be activated and get stronger. Effective weight training depends on proper technique. Incorrect weight training technique can lead to sprains, strains, fractures or other painful injuries that hamper your weight training efforts.</p>

                <strong>Therapeutic Stretching</strong>
                <p>Therapeutic Stretching focuses on the use of both active and passive stretching as part of the rehabilitation of common musculoskeletal conditions and injuries. Covering all forms of stretches for the able-bodied, injured, and selected special populations, Therapeutic Stretching is a comprehensive resource for practitioners and students working in massage therapy, osteopathy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, rehabilitation, and personal and athletic training.</p>
